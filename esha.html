	<!-- Why I'm doing this -->
	<main>
		<h2>You're confused (kot), I get that</h2>
		<p>To start this off, let it be known that, as you already know, I'm interested in pursuing you. Your wit and overall personality (based on what I've seen on your insta) was what got me reeled to you. A little heads up, I tend to go too fast with the grand gestures so do let me know if I start to be a little overwhelming. I can take it down a notch. I'd really like to get to know you better and I hope this could entertain you enough while you're grounded.</p>

	<!-- A little about me -->
	<h2>A little about me</h2>
	<p>Lowkey feel like a job interview but no worries I'll keep it light</p>
	<li>I once won a competition and as I was walking up the stage to get the medal, I tripped and face-planted in front of literally hundreds of people.</li>
	<li>During my piano exam, there's a section called Oral Test where I'd have to sing the notes the examiner played. I got a 3 and remembered my piano teacher saying "You'd never get a 0. They'd always give a 3 for trying".</li>
	<li>I fell into the fountain at KLCC before.</li>
	<li>Was out for a jog at the tasik at subang and a monkey started chasing me around. Felt like I ran a whole marathon.</li>
	<li>I slept in a lecture once and woke up with just me and the lecturer left in the class. Never slept again after that.</li>
	<li>When I was in preschool, I cried so loud everyday to the point where my mom could hear me from the house.</li>
	<li>I was performing once but I had a sore throat that day and I had to sing a pretty high note. Best believe that that was my last ever singing performance.</li>

	<!-- A little about her -->
	<h2>Fuck "What's your favourite colour," I want to know:</h2>
	<li>If you like cars. Because I have an unhealthy amount of lego cars in my room.</li>
	<li>Where you'd go when you're in need of some time alone. I'd go to the beach. Maybe accidentally drown myself in the process.</li>
	<li>Which Spiderman do you like most.</li>
	<li>Okay maybe I do want to know your favourite colour.</li>
	<li>Why you chose civil engineering.</li>
	<li>If I can read any of your poems.</li>
